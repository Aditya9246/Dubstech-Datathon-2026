PROJECT: 2025 HEALTHCARE LATENCY FORECAST
ANALYST: Nipun (UW Bothell - Computer Engineering)
MODEL: Linear Regression (OLS)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. METHODOLOGY SUMMARY:
- Analyzed 75 demographic subgroups using CDC NHIS historical data (2020-2023).
- Filtered for "High-Reliability" trends (R-Squared > 0.70) to ensure predictive accuracy.
- Derived the annual 'Access Velocity' (Slope) for each demographic.

2. PRIMARY SYSTEM OUTLIER:
- Subgroup: American Indian and Alaska Native and White
- Statistical Reliability (R2): 0.9478
- Annual Slope: +2.85% per year
- 2025 Prediction: 20.55% of subgroup priced out of care.

3. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (DIVERGENCE):
- Unlike the majority of demographics (e.g., Veterans, 75+ years, Midwest) which
  show negative slopes (improving access), the AI/AN and White multiracial
  group shows a high-confidence, positive-velocity decline in healthcare access.
- Medicare-eligible groups (75+ years) showed perfect stability (R2: 1.0),
  acting as the control group for system performance.

4. TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATION:
- Deploy targeted financial interventions for the identified outlier group
  to counteract the +2.85% annual barrier growth.
